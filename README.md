# Abstract #

• Dynamic Audio Sensors (DAS) are silicon sensors inspired by the biological cochlea.

• DAS are more energy efficient than standard microphones.

• The DAS has 64 audio frequency channels: each channel fires when there’s a spike in the corresponding frequency.

• We want to evaluate Spiking Neural Networks ability to classify sounds recorded with DAS.
